Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is **Antonia Klatt** and I'm a **biologist** and **organic geochemist** ðŸŒ±

Currently, I'm doing my PhD at University of Basel in the Organic Geochemistry group of Prof. Nemiah Ladd as part of the *ADAPT* project (*Algal Dynamics And Productivity through Time*).

I'm analyzing algal lipid distributions and lipid hydrogen isotope ratios together with sedimentary DNA and pigments in lake sediments for the reconstruction of phytoplankton community composition through different geological timescales.

Find me on ResearchGate net & the Uni Basel website:
